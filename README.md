# Bookmarkletarium

The purpose of the Bookmarkletarium is to provide a single source, extensible way to distribute helpful bookmarklets.

Bookmarklets are stored in an array, and rendered as drag-and-droppable links. Users can access the site and easily add bookmarklets to their browser.

Developers can contribute new bookmarklets by adding to the array, using the template provided. Bookmarklet scripts are stored in JS, so developers can focus on functionality and not URL encoding.

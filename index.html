    <h1>John's Bookmarkletarium</h1>
    <p>
      Bookmarklets live in the same place as bookmarks, but instead of going to a URL, they do something on the internet when you click them. Here's how to get them:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click and drag a bookmarklet from below into your bookmarks toolbar.</li>
      <li>Click on the new bookmark to use it. Many of these copy text to your clipboard invisibly, so just trust they're working, haha.</li>
      <li>To read about what it does, click the question mark.</li>
    </ol>

    <div id="bookmarkletContainer">
      
    </div>
  </body>

  <script src="/bookmarklets/scripts.js"></script>
